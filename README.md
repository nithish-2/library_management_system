# Project Name: 
Library Management System

# Project Description: 
A Library Management System is a software built to handle the primary housekeeping functions of a library. Libraries rely on library management systems to manage asset collections as well as relationships with their members.
Library management systems help libraries keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well as membersâ€™ subscriptions and profiles. The system must be able to maintain database for entering new books and recording books that have been borrowed with their respective due dates.



# SQL Files
- `execute_procedure.sql`: Contains SQL procedures for execution.
- `insert.sql`: SQL commands to insert data.
- `procedure1.sql` to `procedure5.sql`: Various SQL procedures.
- `sequence.sql`: SQL sequences.
- `tables.sql`: SQL commands to create tables.
- `testing.sql`: SQL commands for testing purposes.

# Diagrams
- `lms_erd.png`: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the library management system. Located in the `diagrams/` directory.

# Screenshots
Screenshots showing the functionality and results of the system are located in the `screenshots/` directory.

# How to Use
## 1. Setup Database:
   - Run the scripts in the `sql/` directory in the following order:
     1. `tables.sql`
     2. `sequence.sql`
     3. `insert.sql`
     4. `procedure1.sql` to `procedure5.sql`
     5. `execute_procedure.sql`
     6. `testing.sql` (for testing the setup)

## 2. Viewing Diagrams:
   - The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is located in the `diagrams/` directory.
